# Hackpad-Progress-Tracker

This is a PR tracker for Hack Club's YSWS Hackpad. This project has been a major collaboration between [@scooterthedev](https://github.com/scooterthedev) and [@0CODERKID](https://github.com/0CODERKID). As of now, this project is being hosted on vercel, so it will be a little bit difficult to run locally, but we are hoping to make it easier to host locally in the future.

## How to Test/Run Locally For Testing:
1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/scooterthedev/hackpadtracker.git`
2. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Adjust all the urls for callback to reflect on your hosting.
4. Run `npm run dev` to run the server in dev mode.
5. It now should be running on `https://localhost:5173`!
